# UniversalChiLibs
Updated version of my Chicago Library sample code. All Swift versions are now in one project file with seperate targets. This is where all changes to these samples will occur going forward. Previous sample projects will remain on GitHub, but will not be updated.

Note that I push code to this project from this account and my LLC account (ageswconsulting).
