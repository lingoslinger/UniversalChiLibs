# UniversalChiLibs
Updated version of my Chicago Library sample code. All Swift versions are now in one project file with seperate targets. This is where all changes to these samples will occur going forward. Previous sample projects will remain on GitHub, but *will not be updated.*

Note that I push code to this project from both this account and my LLC account (ageswconsulting). 

The current targets are:


**• SwiftLibraries** - the OG, painstakingly translated from the original Objective-C version

**• SwiftLibsNoSB** - another Swift version, this time using no storyboards

**• SwiftUILibrarie**s - a SwiftUI version

**• CoordinatedSwiftLibs** - yet another Swift version, using the Coordinator pattern

**• tvLibraries - you guessed it, a version for tvOS (in progress)


I have some tenative plans to make one of these targets iPad compatible, when I can find the time.

I would also like to include the Objective-C version here to demostrate Swift/ObjC interoperability, but that seems less necessary as most codebases have migrated to Swift as of this writing (20 Jan 2024.)
